# Write a function `number_range(min_val, max_val, step)` that accepts three numbers as arguments.
# The function should return a list of numbers starting from min_val to max_val (inclusive),
# incremented by step.

def number_range(min_val, max_val, step):
    new_list = []

    for n in range(min_val, max_val+1, step):
        new_list.append(n)
    print(new_list)

# Example:
number_range(10, 40, 5) #-> [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40]
number_range(14, 24, 3) #-> [14, 17, 20, 23]
number_range(8, 35, 6) #-> [8, 14, 20, 26, 32]
