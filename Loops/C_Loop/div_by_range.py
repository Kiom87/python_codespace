# Write a function `divisible_range(min_val, max_val, num)` that prints all numbers
# between min_val and max_val (exclusive) that are divisible by num.
# The function does not return a value, just prints.


def divisible_range(min_val, max_val, num):
   
    for x in range(min_val + 1, max_val):
        if x % num == 0:
            print(x)


         

# Example:
divisible_range(17, 40, 9)
# 18
# 27
# 36

divisible_range(10, 24, 4)
# 12
# 16
# 20
