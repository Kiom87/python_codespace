# Write a function `fizz_buzz(max_num)` that prints all numbers <= max_num
# that are divisible by 3 or 5 but not both.
# The function does not return a value, just prints.




# Example:
fizz_buzz(18)
# 3
# 5
# 6
# 9
# 10
# 12
# 18

fizz_buzz(33)
# 3
# 5
# 6
# 9
# 10
# 12
# 18
# 20
# 21
# 24
# 25
# 27
# 33
